      <h2>Who We Are and What We’re Doing</h2>
      <p>
        Richmond Airlift is a small, community-driven effort to help our
        neighbors during a time of widespread uncertainty. You all know what
        we’re talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
        For many people, leaving the house right now feels unsafe and scary.
        Our goal is to help neighbors stay in their homes while still getting
        everyday things done. This can include picking up groceries or
        prescriptions, getting supplies, walking dogs, shoveling snow, mowing
        grass, or helping with basic household tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        We intentionally keep groups small. If a group grows too large, this
        system is set up so new groups can be created to keep things safer and
        more manageable. If you think a new group is needed, reach out to an
        admin and they can help you figure out next steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this project, neighbors are people requesting help. Helpers are
        people volunteering their time and effort to provide that help. We are
        doing this because our neighbors need support and we have the means to
        offer it.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Helpers Are Signing Up For</h2>
      <p>
        Helpers communicate only through Signal. Signal is an end-to-end
        encrypted messaging app that limits data collection and helps protect
        everyone involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Signal can be used on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux. Many
        helpers use it on both their phone and their computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will try to communicate in English as much as possible. Many of our
        neighbors may not speak English, or may not speak it comfortably. It is
        a good idea to get familiar with a translation app on your phone so you
        can communicate clearly and respectfully when needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project has a flat structure. That means helpers should be careful
        and thoughtful about who is added. Anyone added as a helper should be
        someone you trust completely. We all share responsibility for keeping
        our neighbors safe.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Helper Usernames and Identity Protection</h2>
      <p>
        To make helpers easy to identify and to protect neighbors, helpers use
        a consistent Signal username format.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Usernames should be <code>the</code> plus a name of your choosing</li>
        <li>You may use your real name or a chosen name</li>
        <li>Examples include <code>theAlex</code>, <code>theRiver</code>,
          <code>theJordan</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This helps neighbors quickly recognize who is a helper and reduces the
        risk of someone presenting themselves as a helper when they should not
        be. Everyone should stay alert and speak up if something feels off.
      </p>

      <h3>Getting Started With Signal</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Download Signal:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://signal.org/download/" target="_blank">signal.org/download</a></li>
            <li>Available on the Apple App Store, Google Play, and desktop</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Create your account using your phone number. This number does not
          need to be shared with others.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set your username by going to Settings, then Profile, then Username.
        </li>
        <li>
          In your privacy settings, enable options so people see your username
          and not your phone number.
        </li>
        <li>
          When sharing your contact link, generate the link inside the Signal
          app and use that link.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How the Signal Group Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A neighbor posts a request using a shared template. No identifying
          information is included at this stage.
        </li>
        <li>
          A helper reacts to the request with an emoji to show they are taking
          it.
        </li>
        <li>
          The helper starts a direct message with the neighbor to work out
          details privately.
        </li>
        <li>
          Only in the private message are specific details shared, such as an
          address or grocery list.
        </li>
        <li>
          The helper completes the task so the neighbor can stay safely at home.
        </li>
      </ol>
